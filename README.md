# Heroes of Pymoli
As a Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company, I was assigned the task of analysing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
 
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I was to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. The final report was to include each of the following:

# Summary (Gender)
The findings after calculating the gender demographics conveyed a significant difference between the males in comparison to both females and non-disclosed genders; out of a total count of 780 players across all genders, 652 of those players were males (83.6%). The other/non-disclosed category displayed the least number of players with only 15 (1.9%).

# Summary (Age)
The age range of 20-24 years showed the highest percentage of players, with a total count of 258 players (44.79%). This was to be expected as this age range is where most individuals within this demographic initially become employed and have the finances to make purchases for games. Ages 40 and above had the smallest percentage of players and was also to be expected (2.08%).
